# freebies-to-code

Freebies found on the internet I translated to code. Just HTML, CSS and plain Javascript.

In each folder you will find:

- The code
- A design image or gif
- Credits to the author

Finally I really want to thanks all the talented designers that created the templates. You guys rock ðŸ”¥
